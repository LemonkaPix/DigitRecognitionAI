# DigitRecognitionAI

## 🎯 Project Description
**DigitRecognitionAI** is an project that uses machine learning to recognize handwritten digits. The project was inspired by the video [“Can Water Recognise Numbers? | KNN Digit Recogniser”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC4G_xKK2g8&t=73s) and implemented with my own approach to the problem.

The application uses KNN method to classify images of digits from 0 to 9.

## 🛠 Technologies and Tools
- **C#** – the main programming language
- **Unity** – for visualizing results and simple user interface to draw digits

## 🚀 Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LemonkaPix/DigitRecognitionAI.git
   ```

2. **Open project with Unity Hub**:
   Ensure you have Unity 2022.3.55f1 or later installed

## 🧠 Inspirations
This project was inspired by the YouTube video [Can Water Recognise Numbers? | KNN Digit Recogniser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC4G_xKK2g8&t=73s). However, I introduced my own modifications, such as improving the user interface and the training process.
